##Create a Python program that identifies all numbers between 100 and 300 (inclusive) that are divisible by 7 but not multiples of 5. The identified numbers should be displayed in a single line, separated by commas.

def find_numberss(num1 , num2):
    find_numbers = [1]
    for i in range(1,300):
        find_numbers.append(i)
        if find_numbers[i] >= 100 and find_numbers[i] <= 200 and find_numbers[i] % 7 == 0 and find_numbers[i] % 5 != 0:
            print(i)
    

find_numberss(100,200)
